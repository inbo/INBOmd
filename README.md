INBOmd contains templates to generate several types of documents with the corporate identity of INBO or the Flemish government.
The current package has following Rmarkdown templates:

- INBO report: reports rendered to pdf, html (gitbook style) and epub
- INBO slides: presentations rendered to pdf
- INBO poster: poster rendered to a A0 pdf
- Flanders slides: presentations using the Flemish corporate identity, rendered to pdf

The templates are available in RStudio using `File` > `New file` > `R Markdown` > `From template`.

More details, including instructions for installation and usage are available at the [INBOmd website](https://inbo.github.io/INBOmd/articles/introduction.html).

## Installation

INBOmd requires a working LaTeX distribution (for conversion of markdown
to pdf).
We highly recommend to use the LaTeX distribution provided by R
package TinyTeX.
Close all open R sessions and start a fresh R session.
Execute the commands below.
This will install the R package TinyTeX and the TinyTex LaTeX distribution
on your machine.
No admin rights are required.
Although TinyTeX is a lightweight installation, it still is several 100 MB large.

```
update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
if (!"tinytex" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("tinytex")
}
# install the TinyTeX LaTeX distribution
if (!tinytex:::is_tinytex()) {
  tinytex::install_tinytex()
}
```

Once TinyTeX is installed, you need to restart RStudio.
Then you can proceed with the installation of `INBOmd`.

```
# installation from inbo.r-universe
install.packages("INBOmd", repos = "https://inbo.r-universe.dev")

## alternative: installation from github
#if (!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
#  install.packages("remotes")
#}
#remotes::install_github("inbo/INBOmd", dependencies = TRUE)

# add the local latex package contained in INBOmd to the TinyTeX install 
tinytex::tlmgr_conf(
  c("auxtrees", "add", system.file("local_tex", package = "INBOmd"))
)

# install some other needed latex packages 
tinytex::tlmgr_install(c(
  "inconsolata", "times", "tex", "helvetic", "dvips", "hyphen-dutch",
  "hyphen-french"
))
```
